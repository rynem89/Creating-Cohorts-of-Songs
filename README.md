# Creating-Cohorts-of-Songs

Problem Scenario:

Spotify, a leading audio streaming platform, aims to enhance song recommendations by creating personalized cohorts based on various song features. This will help cater to the individual preferences of their vast user base and improve customer engagement.

Problem Objective:

As a data scientist, you will conduct exploratory data analysis and cluster analysis on a dataset of Rolling Stones songs to:

Understand the factors that define song cohorts.
Create song clusters based on these factors.
Data Description:

The dataset contains information about all Rolling Stones albums on Spotify, including:

Song Name: The name of the song.
Album Name: The name of the album.
Release Date: The day, month, and year the album was released.
Track Number: The order in which the song appears on the album.
Spotify ID: The unique identifier for the song on Spotify.
Spotify URI: The Spotify URI for the song.
Acousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating whether the track is acoustic.
Danceability: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on musical elements.
Energy: A measure of intensity and activity.
Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains vocals.
Liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.
Loudness: The overall loudness of the track in decibels.
Speechiness: Detects the presence of spoken words in a track.
Tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute. Â  
Valence: A measure of the musical positivity conveyed by a track.
Popularity: The popularity of the song.
Duration (ms): The duration of the track in milliseconds.
Steps to Perform:

Data Inspection and Cleaning:

Check for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Handle any inconsistencies or errors in the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the distribution of each feature.
Identify correlations between features.
Visualize the data to gain insights.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features if necessary (e.g., combining multiple features).
Scale numerical features to ensure they have a similar range.
Cluster Analysis:

Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.
Apply appropriate clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN).
Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to understand the factors that define them.
